For this exercise, you will want to db migrate and seed. There are 4 foxes in the db so just pick a number(1-4) and add that to your GET url. 

The image of the fox should show up on the page, any comments should show up, if it has any likes, they should show up too.

If you click the like button, it should increase the likes number on the page and that change should persist. 

You should be able to add a comment that optimistically renders and persists.

Bonus if you can delete the optimistic comment!
